			<h1>Internet Programming - Assignment 1</h1>
			<p class="lead">
				This assignment requires you to create an Online Travel Agency. Visitors to the site can book airline
				tickets and pay by credit card. Details of the trips booked by them are sent by email.
				The website is menu driven. You can use the basic site code (including image maps) learned from the
				lecture or you can use your own code if you prefer. The first thing you will have to do is add a
				"Your Bookings" menu option. This can be added as part of the main menu or (preferably) as a
				link elsewhere on the page. It should always be available to visitors to the site no
				matter what web page on the site they happen to be looking at.
